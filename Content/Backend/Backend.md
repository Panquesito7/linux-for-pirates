# **Backend**

Backend developers are responsible for creating and maintaining the systems and infrastructure that power your network. Backend developers typically work on the "backend" of a website or application, which refers to the servers, databases, and other systems that support the frontend (the user-facing part of the site or application).

- Backend developers often work on tasks such as:

**Developing and maintaining server-side software:** This might include creating and managing databases, implementing server-side logic and business logic, and integrating with third-party systems.

**Designing and implementing APIs:** Backend developers might create APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) that allow different systems and applications to communicate with each other.

**Managing infrastructure:** Backend developers might be responsible for maintaining and scaling the servers, databases, and other infrastructure that support a website or application.

**Collaborating with frontend developers:** Backend developers often work closely with frontend developers to ensure that the backend systems and infrastructure support the needs of the user-facing part of the site or application.

You might imagine that backend developers are responsible for creating and maintaining the systems that power your network.
