## **DNS (Domain Name System)**

In the context of the internet, the Domain Name System (DNS) is a decentralized system that maps human-readable domain names (such as "example.com") to the numerical IP addresses that computers use to communicate with each other. DNS helps to make it easier for people to access websites and other online resources, as it allows us to use easy-to-remember names instead of having to remember complex numerical addresses.

In a pirate theme, you could think of DNS as a way to navigate the vast and often-treacherous seas of the internet. Just as a map helps a pirate to find their way from one island to another, DNS helps to guide internet users to the websites and online resources they are looking for. Instead of having to remember the exact location of each island (website), a pirate can simply consult their map (DNS) to find the right route.

DNS also helps to ensure that internet users can reach their destination even if the underlying landscape (IP addresses) changes. Just as a pirate might need to adjust their course if the winds or currents shift, DNS can automatically route internet users to the correct location even if the underlying IP addresses change. This helps to make the internet more reliable and accessible, even in the midst of constantly-changing conditions.

### **Types of DNS Records**

There are several different types of DNS records that can be used to map domain names to IP addresses. The most common types of DNS records are A records, which map a domain name to a single IP address, and CNAME records, which map a domain name to another domain name. Other types of DNS records include MX records, which map a domain name to an email server, and TXT records, which can be used to store arbitrary text data.

### **Examples of DNS Records**

**A record:**

`pirate.com.      IN A      127.0.0.1`

This A record maps the domain name "pirate.com" to the IP address `127.0.0.1`.

**CNAME record:**

`pirateship.pirate.com.      IN CNAME      pirate.com.`

This CNAME record maps the domain name "pirateship.pirate.com" to the domain name "pirate.com".

**MX record:**

`pirate.com.      IN MX      10 mail.pirate.com.`

This MX record specifies that the mail server for the domain "pirate.com" is located at "mail.pirate.com". The number "10" is the preference value, which determines the priority of the mail server.

**NS record:**

`pirate.com.      IN NS      ns1.pirate.com.
pirate.com.      IN NS      ns2.pirate.com.`

These NS records specify the name servers for the domain "pirate.com".

### **DNS servers**

Ahoy there! DNS servers be the computers that store the DNS records for a given domain. When a user tries to access a website, their computer will first query a DNS server to find the IP address for the requested domain. The DNS server will then return the IP address to the user's computer, which can then use the IP address to connect to the requested website.

**DNSSEC**

DNSSEC (Domain Name System Security Extensions) be a set of extensions to the DNS protocol that help to ensure that DNS queries and responses be secure and authentic. It does this by adding digital signatures to DNS records, which can be used to verify that the DNS records have not been tampered with. It also adds a mechanism for verifying that the DNS server that is responding to a query be the correct DNS server for the requested domain.

**DNS over HTTPS (DoH)**

DNS over HTTPS (DoH) be a protocol that allows DNS queries to be sent over HTTPS instead of the traditional DNS protocol. This allows DNS queries to be sent over an encrypted connection, which helps to ensure that DNS queries and responses be secure and private.

**DNS over TLS (DoT)**

DNS over TLS (DoT) be a protocol that allows DNS queries to be sent over TLS instead of the traditional DNS protocol. This allows DNS queries to be sent over an encrypted connection, which helps to ensure that DNS queries and responses be secure and private.

**DNS over QUIC (DoQ)**

DNS over QUIC (DoQ) be a protocol that allows DNS queries to be sent over QUIC instead of the traditional DNS protocol. This allows DNS queries to be sent over an encrypted connection, which helps to ensure that DNS queries and responses be secure and private.

**DNSCrypt**

DNSCrypt be a protocol that allows DNS queries to be sent over an encrypted connection, which helps to ensure that DNS queries and responses be secure and private. It does this by encrypting DNS queries and responses using the NaCl (Networking and Cryptography library) encryption library.

**DNS Amplification Attacks**

DNS amplification attacks be a type of denial-of-service (DoS) attack that can be used to flood a target server with large amounts of traffic. They work by sending a large number of DNS queries to a DNS server, which will then respond to each query with a large amount of data. This can be used to flood a target server with large amounts of traffic, which can cause the server to become overloaded and crash.

**Hosts file**

The hosts file be a file that can be used to map domain names to IP addresses. It be typically located at `/etc/hosts` on Linux systems, but the exact location may vary depending on the operating system. The hosts file can be used to override the DNS records for a given domain, which can be useful for testing purposes.

## **HTTP**

HTTP, or Hypertext Transfer Protocol, is a protocol for transmitting data on the internet. It is the foundation of the World Wide Web, and is used to transfer data from a server to a client, or vice versa.

In a pirate theme, you could think of HTTP as the system that allows pirates to send and receive messages and information as they sail the seas of the internet. Just like a pirate ship uses a flag to communicate with other ships, a website uses HTTP to communicate with a client's web browser. When you enter a website's address into your browser, your browser sends an HTTP request to the server hosting the website. The server then responds with an HTTP response, which includes the content of the website.

HTTP is just one of many protocols that make the internet work, but it is an important one because it allows us to access and interact with websites and other online resources. Arrr!

### **HTTP error codes**

HTTP error codes are a set of standardized codes that are used to indicate the status of an HTTP request. They are returned by the server in the HTTP response, and can be used to determine whether a request was successful or not.

Here are some of the most common HTTP error codes:

- 200 OK - The request was successful
- 301 Moved Permanently - The requested resource has been moved permanently
- 302 Found - The requested resource has been moved temporarily
- 400 Bad Request - The request was invalid
- 401 Unauthorized - The request requires authentication
- 403 Forbidden - The server refused to fulfill the request
- 404 Not Found - The requested resource could not be found
- 500 Internal Server Error - An error occurred on the server
- 503 Service Unavailable - The server is currently unavailable

For a bit of a laugh, here is an image you'll see as a 404 error page on some of my applications: (not to be taken seriously)

![404](images/404.png)

Here are some more obscure HTTP error codes:

- 418 I'm a teapot - The server refuses to brew coffee because it is a teapot
- 451 Unavailable For Legal Reasons - The requested resource is unavailable due to legal reasons

### **HTTP methods**

HTTP methods are a set of standardized methods that are used to indicate the action that should be performed for a given resource. They are used in the HTTP request, and can be used to determine what action should be performed on the server.

Here are some of the most common HTTP methods:

- **GET** - Retrieve a resource
- **POST** - Create a resource
- **PUT** - Update a resource
- **DELETE** - Delete a resource

HTTP methods can also be used to indicate the type of data that is being sent in the request. For example, the `Content-Type` header can be used to indicate that the request body contains JSON data.

Here are some of the most common `Content-Type` values:

- `application/json` - JSON data
- `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` - Form data
- `multipart/form-data` - Form data with file uploads

### **HTTP headers**

HTTP headers are a set of standardized fields that are used to send additional information with an HTTP request or response. They are used to provide additional context about the request or response, and can be used to pass additional information between the client and the server.

Here are some of the most common HTTP headers:

- `Accept` - The types of data that the client can accept
- `Accept-Encoding` - The types of data encoding that the client can accept
- `Accept-Language` - The languages that the client can accept
- `Authorization` - The credentials that the client can use to authenticate
- `Cache-Control` - The caching behavior that the client can accept
- `Content-Length` - The length of the request body
- `Content-Type` - The type of data that is contained in the request body
- `Cookie` - The cookies that the client can send to the server
- `Host` - The host name of the server
- `User-Agent` - The user agent that the client is using

HTTP headers can also be used to pass additional information between the client and the server. For example, the `X-Forwarded-For` header can be used to pass the IP address of the client to the server.

### **HTTPS**

HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure) can be thought of as a way to secure communication between two parties. HTTPS is a protocol that is used to transmit data over the internet, and it is designed to provide an additional layer of security on top of the regular HTTP protocol.

Imagine that two pirates are trying to send messages to each other over the internet, but they are worried that their messages might be intercepted by other pirates or other parties. To secure their communication, they could use HTTPS. When they use HTTPS, their messages are encrypted, which means that they are transformed into a code that can only be deciphered by the intended recipient. This makes it much harder for anyone else to intercept and read the messages, as they would need to have the key to decrypt the code.

In addition to encryption, HTTPS also provides authentication, which means that it can verify the identity of the sender and the recipient. This helps to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks, where a third party tries to intercept and manipulate the communication between two parties.

Overall, HTTPS is a useful tool for pirates (or anyone else) who want to keep their communication private and secure. It can help protect against interception and tampering, and it can also provide reassurance that the messages are actually coming from the intended sender.

### **API (Application Programming Interface)**

An API (Application Programming Interface) can be thought of as a set of standardized methods that are used to interact with a web application. It is a way for a client to communicate with a server, and it can be used to retrieve data from the server or to send data to the server.

In a pirate theme, you could think of an API as a way for a pirate to interact with a web application. Just like a pirate uses a telescope to look for treasure, a client uses an API to retrieve data from a server. Similarly, just like a pirate uses a telescope to look for treasure, a client uses an API to send data to a server.

APIs are often used to retrieve data from a server, but they can also be used to send data to a server. For example, an API can be used to create a new user account or to update an existing user account.

#### **GraphQL (Graph Query Language)**

GraphQL (Graph Query Language) can be thought of as a set of standardized methods that are used to interact with a web application. It is a way for a client to communicate with a server, and it can be used to retrieve data from the server or to send data to the server.

In a pirate theme, you could think of GraphQL as a way for a pirate to interact with a web application. Just like a pirate uses a telescope to look for treasure, a client uses an API to retrieve data from a server. Similarly, just like a pirate uses a telescope to look for treasure, a client uses an API to send data to a server.

GraphQL is often used to retrieve data from a server, but it can also be used to send data to a server. For example, an API can be used to create a new user account or to update an existing user account.

#### **REST (Representational State Transfer)**

REST (Representational State Transfer) can be thought of as a set of standardized principles that are used to design web applications. It is a way to design web applications so that they can be easily accessed and used by clients.

In a pirate theme, you could think of REST as a set of principles that are used to design web applications. Just like a pirate uses a telescope to look for treasure, a client uses an API to retrieve data from a server. Similarly, just like a pirate uses a telescope to look for treasure, a client uses an API to send data to a server.

REST is often used to retrieve data from a server, but it can also be used to send data to a server. For example, an API can be used to create a new user account or to update an existing user account.

#### **SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol)**

SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) can be thought of as a set of standardized methods that are used to interact with a web application. It is a way for a client to communicate with a server, and it can be used to retrieve data from the server or to send data to the server.

In a pirate theme, you could think of SOAP as a way for a pirate to interact with a web application. Just like a pirate uses a telescope to look for treasure, a client uses an API to retrieve data from a server. Similarly, just like a pirate uses a telescope to look for treasure, a client uses an API to send data to a server.

SOAP is often used to retrieve data from a server, but it can also be used to send data to a server. For example, an API can be used to create a new user account or to update an existing user account.
