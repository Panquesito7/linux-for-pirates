# **Linux**

## **What is Linux?**

Linux is a free and open-source operating system that was created by Linus Torvalds in 1991. At the time, Linus was a computer science student at the University of Helsinki in Finland, and was interested in creating an operating system that would be more flexible and open than the proprietary operating systems that were available.

Linus began working on Linux as a hobby project, and released the first version of the operating system on the internet in 1991. He made the source code for Linux available to anyone who wanted it, and encouraged other pirates to contribute to the project by writing code and helping to debug and improve the operating system.

Linux is based on the Unix operating system, which was developed in the 1970s and 1980s by a group of pirates at AT&T's Bell Labs. Unix is a powerful and flexible operating system that is widely used by pirates for a variety of purposes, including running servers, developing software, and performing scientific and technical computing.

Linus's goal with Linux was to create an operating system that would be free and open, and that would allow pirates to freely modify and distribute the source code. This was in contrast to proprietary operating systems, such as Microsoft Windows, which were closed and required users to pay for a license.

Linux quickly gained popularity among pirates, and a large community of developers and users began to form around the project. Over time, Linux has evolved into a powerful and widely used operating system, with versions available for a wide variety of devices, including servers, desktop computers, laptops, smartphones, and smart TVs.

Today, Linux is an important part of the open source software movement, and is used by pirates around the world for a variety of purposes, including running servers, developing software, and as a platform for scientific and technical computing. It is known for its stability, security, and flexibility, and is an essential tool in the arsenal of any self-respecting pirate. Arrr!

### **What is GNU?**

GNU is a free and open-source operating system that was created by Richard Stallman in 1983. At the time, Stallman was a computer science student at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), and was interested in creating an operating system that would be more flexible and open than the proprietary operating systems that were available.

Stallman began working on GNU as a hobby project, and released the first version of the operating system in 1983. He made the source code for GNU available to anyone who wanted it, and encouraged other pirates to contribute to the project by writing code and helping to debug and improve the operating system.
