# **Linux**

## **What is Linux?**

Linux is a free and open-source operating system that was created by Linus Torvalds in 1991. At the time, Linus was a computer science student at the University of Helsinki in Finland, and was interested in creating an operating system that would be more flexible and open than the proprietary operating systems that were available.

Linus began working on Linux as a hobby project, and released the first version of the operating system on the internet in 1991. He made the source code for Linux available to anyone who wanted it, and encouraged other pirates to contribute to the project by writing code and helping to debug and improve the operating system.

Linux is based on the Unix operating system, which was developed in the 1970s and 1980s by a group of pirates at AT&T's Bell Labs. Unix is a powerful and flexible operating system that is widely used by pirates for a variety of purposes, including running servers, developing software, and performing scientific and technical computing.

Linus's goal with Linux was to create an operating system that would be free and open, and that would allow pirates to freely modify and distribute the source code. This was in contrast to proprietary operating systems, such as Microsoft Windows, which were closed and required users to pay for a license.

Linux quickly gained popularity among pirates, and a large community of developers and users began to form around the project. Over time, Linux has evolved into a powerful and widely used operating system, with versions available for a wide variety of devices, including servers, desktop computers, laptops, smartphones, and smart TVs.

Today, Linux is an important part of the open source software movement, and is used by pirates around the world for a variety of purposes, including running servers, developing software, and as a platform for scientific and technical computing. It is known for its stability, security, and flexibility, and is an essential tool in the arsenal of any self-respecting pirate. Arrr!

### **What is GNU?**

GNU is a free and open-source operating system that was created by Richard Stallman in 1983. At the time, Stallman was a computer science student at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), and was interested in creating an operating system that would be more flexible and open than the proprietary operating systems that were available.

Stallman began working on GNU as a hobby project, and released the first version of the operating system in 1983. He made the source code for GNU available to anyone who wanted it, and encouraged other pirates to contribute to the project by writing code and helping to debug and improve the operating system.

### **Handybilly**

A handybilly is a notebook that a pirate should carry with them at all times. It be used to keep track of important information, such as passwords, notes, and other useful tidbits. Ye can use yer handybilly to keep track of the information that ye learn in this book.

`ls`: This command be used to list the files and directories in a directory. Ye can use it to see what be in yer current directory or specify a different directory to list.

`cd`: This command be used to change the current directory ye be working in. Ye can use it to navigate to different directories on yer system.

`pwd`: This command be used to print the current working directory. Ye can use it to see where ye be in the file system.

`mkdir`: This command be used to create a new directory. Ye can use it to create directories to organize yer files.

`touch`: This command be used to create a new file. Ye can use it to create empty files or update the timestamp on an existing file.

`cp`: This command be used to copy files and directories. Ye can use it to make copies of yer files or move them to different locations on yer system.

`mv`: This command be used to move or rename files and directories. Ye can use it to rearrange yer files or change their names.

`rm`: This command be used to delete files and directories. Ye can use it to remove unwanted files from yer system.

#### **Bash**

Ahoy matey! Bash, or the Bourne-Again Shell, is a command-line interpreter for Linux and other Unix-like operating systems. Just like how a pirate might use a compass to navigate through the open seas, Bash helps users navigate and interact with their operating system by allowing them to enter commands and execute programs.

Bash is a powerful tool that allows users to perform a wide variety of tasks, including running programs, creating and editing files and directories, and managing system processes. It also provides features like command history, tab completion, and shell scripting, which allow users to automate tasks and customize their environment.

To use Bash, a pirate would open a terminal window and type commands at the prompt. The prompt is a symbol that indicates that Bash is ready to accept commands, and it usually looks something like this:

```bash
pirate@cove:~$
```

The prompt includes the username (pirate), the hostname (cove), and the current working directory (indicated by the tilde character).

Bash supports a wide variety of commands, including built-in commands like `ls` (list the contents of a directory) and `cd` (change the current working directory), as well as external programs like `grep` (search for patterns in text) and `awk` (process text).

I hope this helps you understand what Bash is and how a pirate might use it to interact with their operating system. Arrr!

##### **.bashrc**

Ahoy matey! In the world of Linux, the `.bashrc` file is a configuration file that contains commands that are executed when a user logs in to their system. Just like how a pirate might use a treasure map to find their way to their treasure, the `.bashrc` file can be used to customize a user's environment and make it easier for them to perform common tasks.

An example `.bashrc` file might look something like this:

```bash
# Set the prompt to include the current time
PS1="\[\e[32m\]\u@\h \[\e[33m\]\w\[\e[35m\] \t\[\e[m\]\$ "

# Set the default editor to Vim
export EDITOR=vim

# Set an alias for the ls command
alias ls='ls --color=auto'
```

The first line sets the prompt to include the current time. The second line sets the default editor to Vim. The third line sets an alias for the `ls` command, which is a shortcut that can be used to run the command. For example, a pirate could type `ls` instead of `ls --color=auto`.

##### **Bash scripting**

Ahoy matey! In the world of Linux, Bash scripting is a powerful tool that allows pirates (and users) to automate tasks and customize their environment. Just like how a pirate might use a treasure map to find their way to their treasure, Bash scripts can be used to automate common tasks and make it easier for users to perform repetitive operations.

A Bash script is a plain text file that contains a series of commands that are executed in order. For example, a pirate might create a script that backs up their important documents to a USB drive. The script might look something like this:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Backup important documents to a USB drive
cp -r /home/pirate/Documents /media/usb
```

The first line of the script is called the shebang, and it tells the system which program should be used to execute the script. In this case, the shebang tells the system to use the Bash interpreter to execute the script.

The second line is a comment, which is a line that is ignored by the system. Comments are useful for providing information about the script, such as what it does and how it should be used.

The third line is the actual command that is executed by the script. In this case, the command copies the `Documents` directory from the user's home directory to the USB drive.

I hope this helps you understand what Bash scripting is and how a pirate might use it to automate tasks and customize their environment. Arrr!

##### **Bash history**

Ahoy matey! In the world of Linux, the Bash history is a list of commands that have been executed in the current session. Just like how a pirate might use a treasure map to find their way to their treasure, the Bash history can be used to view a list of commands that have been executed in the current session.

The Bash history is a list of commands that have been executed in the current session. For example, a pirate might use the `ls` command to view a list of files in the current directory. If the pirate then uses the `cd` command to change the current directory, the `ls` command will be added to the Bash history.

The Bash history can be viewed by using the `history` command. The `history` command will display a list of commands that have been executed in the current session, along with the line number of each command. The line number can be used to re-execute a command.

I hope this helps you understand what the Bash history is and how a pirate might use it to view a list of commands that have been executed in the current session. Arrr!

##### **Bash one-liners**

Ahoy matey! In the world of Linux, a Bash one-liner is a command that can be used to perform a single task. Just like how a pirate might use a treasure map to find their way to their treasure, Bash one-liners can be used to perform a single task.

A Bash one-liner is a command that can be used to perform a single task. For example, a pirate might use the `ls` command to view a list of files in the current directory. If the pirate then uses the `grep` command to search for a specific file, the `ls | grep` command will be a Bash one-liner.

Bash one-liners can be used to perform a wide variety of tasks, including searching for files, counting lines, and sorting text. The `man` command can be used to view the manual page for a command, which will provide information about how the command can be used.

I hope this helps you understand what a Bash one-liner is and how a pirate might use it to perform a single task. Arrr!

- "I be needin' to list all the files in this folder, arrr!"

`ls`

- "I be needin' to see the contents of this file, arrr!"

`cat [filename]`

- "I be needin' to search for a specific string in all the files in this folder, arrr!"

`grep "[search string]" *`

- "I be needin' to see all the processes runnin' on this machine, arrr!"

`ps aux`

- "I be needin' to see the available disk space on this machine, arrr!"

`df -h`

- "I be needin' to see the network connections on this machine, arrr!"

`netstat -tulpn`

- "I be needin' to see the system logs, arrr!"

`tail -f /var/log/syslog`

### **chroot**

Ahoy matey! The `chroot` command is used to change the root directory for the current shell session. Ye can use it to run a command or shell with a different root directory.

```bash
# Change root directory to /tmp (bash)
chroot /tmp bash
# Change root directory to /tmp (sh)
chroot /tmp sh
# Change root directory to /tmp (zsh)
chroot /tmp zsh
# Change root directory to /tmp (fish)
chroot /tmp fish
```

### **Cron**

[Crontab.guru](https://crontab.guru)

Ahoy matey! In the world of Linux, cron is a powerful tool that allows pirates (and users) to schedule tasks to be automatically executed at a specific time or interval. This can be useful for tasks that need to be run regularly, such as backing up important documents or cleaning up temporary files.

Cron uses a configuration file called the `crontab` to specify the tasks that it should execute. Each line in the crontab file represents a single task, and consists of six fields separated by spaces:

Minute (0-59)
Hour (0-23)
Day of the month (1-31)
Month of the year (1-12)
Day of the week (0-6, with 0 representing Sunday)
Command to execute
For example, to schedule a task to be executed every day at midnight, a pirate might add the following line to their crontab file:

```bash
0 0 * * * /path/to/task
```

To edit the crontab file, a pirate can use the `crontab -e` command. This will open the file in a text editor, where they can add, modify, or delete tasks as needed.

It's important to note that cron tasks are executed with the permissions of the user who owns the crontab file, so it's important to make sure that the tasks have the necessary permissions to run correctly.

I hope this helps you understand how cron works and how a pirate might use it to automate tasks on their Linux system. Arrr!

### **Devices**

Ahoy matey! In the world of Linux, a device is a piece of hardware that is connected to the system. Just like how a pirate might use a treasure map to find their way to their treasure, devices can be used to interact with the operating system.

A device can be thought of as a piece of hardware that is connected to the system. For example, a pirate might use a USB drive to store their treasure map. The USB drive can be thought of as a device that is connected to the system.

The `lsblk` command can be used to view a list of all the devices that are currently connected to the system. The `lsblk` command will display a list of devices, along with information about each device, such as the device name, size, and type.

I hope this helps you understand what a device is and how a pirate might use it to interact with the operating system. Arrr!

### **Drivers**

Ahoy matey! In the world of Linux, a driver is a program that allows a device to interact with the operating system. Just like how a pirate might use a treasure map to find their way to their treasure, drivers can be used to interact with the operating system.

A driver can be thought of as a program that allows a device to interact with the operating system. For example, a pirate might use a USB drive to store their treasure map. The USB drive can be thought of as a device that is connected to the system. The driver for the USB drive allows the device to interact with the operating system.

The `lsmod` command can be used to view a list of all the drivers that are currently loaded on the system. The `lsmod` command will display a list of drivers, along with information about each driver, such as the driver name, size, and type.

I hope this helps you understand what a driver is and how a pirate might use it to interact with the operating system. Arrr!

### **Processes**

Ahoy matey! In the world of Linux, a process is a program that is currently running on the system. Just like how a pirate might use a treasure map to find their way to their treasure, processes can be used to perform tasks and interact with the operating system.

A process can be thought of as an instance of a program. For example, a pirate might run a program called `treasure_hunt` to search for their treasure. If the pirate runs the program again, a new process will be created to run the program. The pirate can use the `ps` command to view a list of all the processes that are currently running on the system.

A process can be thought of as a program that is currently running on the system. For example, a pirate might run a program called `treasure_hunt` to search for their treasure. If the pirate runs the program again, a new process will be created to run the program. The pirate can use the `ps` command to view a list of all the processes that are currently running on the system.

An example of how to kill a process using the `kill` command:

```bash
kill 1234
```

To find the process ID of a process, a pirate can use the `ps` command. The `ps` command will display a list of processes, along with information about each process, such as the process ID, name, and status.

I hope this helps you understand what a process is and how a pirate might use it to perform tasks and interact with the operating system. Arrr!

### **curl**

curl be a command line tool for transferring data using various network protocols. It be a powerful tool that be widely used by systems administrators and developers for a variety of tasks, such as testing APIs, downloading files, and more. Here be some basics ye should know to use cURL:

**Syntax:** The basic syntax for using cURL be `curl [options] [URL]`. Ye can specify various options to control how cURL be behavior, and then specify the URL of the resource ye be requesting.

**Protocols:** cURL support a wide range of network protocols, including HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, SFTP, and more. Ye can specify the protocol ye be using by including it in the URL, or ye can use the -P option to specify the protocol.

**HTTP methods:** cURL support all of the HTTP methods, including `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE`, and more. Ye can use the `-X` option to specify the method ye be using.

Request headers: cURL allow ye to specify custom request headers to be sent with yer request. Ye can use the `-H` option to specify a header, such as `-H "Content-Type: application/json"` to specify the content type of yer request.

Request data: cURL allow ye to specify data to be sent with yer request, such as form data or a `JSON` payload. Ye can use the -d option to specify the data ye be sending.

> **Note** If ye be sending JSON data, ye should use the `--data-raw` option instead of the `-d` option. The `-d` option will escape the JSON payload, which will cause the request to fail.

Response headers: cURL allow ye to view the response headers that be returned with yer request. Ye can use the `-i` option to view the response headers.

Response body: cURL allow ye to view the response body that be returned with yer request. Ye can use the `-o` option to save the response body to a file, or ye can use the `-O` option to save the response body to a file with the same name as the file on the server.

I hope this helps you understand how cURL works and how a pirate might use it to make HTTP requests. Arrr!

> **Note** if ye ever get stuck use `curl cht.sh/:help` to get help

A typical cURL `GET` request would look like this:

```bash
curl -X GET -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"name": "Pirate"}' https://example.com
```

A typical cURL `POST` request would look like this:

```bash
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"name": "Pirate"}' https://example.com
```
